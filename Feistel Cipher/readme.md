Feistel Cipher Implementation  
The Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in block cipher algorithms.  
It splits the plaintext into two halves and processes them through several rounds of encryption.  
Each round involves operations such as bitwise XOR, addition, and key mixing.  

Features  
- Converts plaintext into an 8-bit binary representation.  
- Splits the binary representation into left and right halves for encryption.  
- Uses a key to perform bitwise operations for encryption and decryption.  
- Reconstructs the original plaintext after decryption.
