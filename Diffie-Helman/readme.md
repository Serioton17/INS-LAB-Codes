Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Implementation  
Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm that allows two parties to securely share a cryptographic key over a public channel.  
It is based on the mathematical properties of modular exponentiation and discrete logarithms.  

Features  
- Computes public keys for two users.  
- Generates a shared secret key between two communicating parties.  
- Ensures secure key exchange without transmitting the private keys.

Output  
```
prime no.: 23  
premitive root: 5  
PvA: 6  
PvB: 15  
Public Key of A:  8  
Public Key of B:  19  
shared key of A:  2  
Shared key of B:  2  
Shared key is the same. Key exchange is perfect...
