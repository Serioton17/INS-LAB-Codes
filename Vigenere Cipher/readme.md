Vigenère Cipher Implementation  
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on letters of a keyword.  
It is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that improves upon the simple Caesar cipher by using multiple shift values.  
The strength of this cipher lies in the complexity introduced by the keyword.  

Features  
- Encrypts messages using the Vigenère cipher technique.  
- Decrypts encrypted messages back to their original form.  
- Automatically extends the key to match the length of the message.  
- Works only with uppercase letters (spaces are removed automatically).
