Caesar Cipher  
- The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.  
- It is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to secure his communications.  
- Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in the alphabet by a fixed amount.  

Features  
- Encrypts messages using the Caesar cipher  
- Decrypts encrypted messages back to their original form  
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Retains spaces and special characters unchanged
