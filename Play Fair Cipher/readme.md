Playfair Cipher Implementation  
The Playfair cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters instead of single letters. It was invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854 but is named after Lord Playfair, who promoted its use.  
It uses a 5x5 matrix of letters derived from a keyword, omitting 'J' or replacing it with 'I'.  
The encryption process follows specific rules depending on the positioning of letter pairs within the matrix.  

Features  
- Encrypts messages using the Playfair cipher.  
- Handles duplicate letters and odd-length messages by inserting filler characters.  
- Uses a keyword to dynamically generate the cipher matrix.
