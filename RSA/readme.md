RSA Implementation  
RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a pair of keys: public and private.  
The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption.  
It relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.  

Features  
- Generates RSA public and private key pairs.  
- Encrypts and decrypts numerical messages.  
- Uses modular exponentiation for encryption and decryption.
