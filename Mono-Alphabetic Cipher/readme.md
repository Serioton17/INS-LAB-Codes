Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher Implementation  
The Monoalphabetic substitution cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with a corresponding letter from a fixed, scrambled alphabet.  
It is a simple yet effective encryption method where the key determines how the letters are substituted.  
The security of this cipher relies on keeping the mapping secret.  

Features  
- Encrypts messages using a predefined substitution alphabet.  
- Decrypts encrypted messages back to their original form.  
- Retains spaces and special characters unchanged.
